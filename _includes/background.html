            I recently graduated from
            <a class="underline-link" href="https://web.ncku.edu.tw/" target="_blank">National Cheng Kung University</a> in Taiwan
            with a master's degree in computer engineering. I've done internships at several companies such as
            <a class="underline-link" href="https://career.scg.com/en/internship/excellent_internship_program" target="_blank">SCG</a>,
            <a class="underline-link" href=https://www.sellsuki.co.th/" target="_blank">Sellsuki</a>, and
            <a class="underline-link" href="http://mfu.ac.th/" target="_blank">Mae Fah Luang University</a>

            As a full-stack developer, I'm responsible for getting requirements until deploying the web to the server (basically, the entire circle).
            I've built a number of web applications such as university systems, e-commerce web app,
            dormitory websites, currency exchange web app. I love to write a neat code following conventions and best practices.
            My goal is always to build applications that are readable and maintainable.

            <strong>While I'm away from the computer</strong>, I love watching football, playing games, and strumming guitar.

            <strong>I'm passionate about</strong> learning languages, technology trends, self-leaning.
