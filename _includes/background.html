      <p>Hi! I'm Max, a software engineer based in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>

      <p>
        I'm a tech enthusiast who loves to build things for the web with more than 6 years' experience in technical fields. 
        Skilled in software development, technical & architecture design, agile methodologies, coding practices, and team management. 
        Excellent in collaborating with cross-functional teams working on several areas whether tech or business. 
        Developing a high-quality software is always done with an emphasis on best practices for quality delivery. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a developer, I love to write neat code following conventions and best practices. I always try to make 
        best practices of every written code. My goal is always to build applications that are readable and maintainable.
        Iâ€™m not only fascinated by the technical side but also the business and design side. I believe that understanding business altogether with design can make me a better developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>While I'm away from the computer</strong>, I love reading the Bible, watching football (a huge fan of Chelsea), playing games, and strumming guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I'm also passionate about</strong> learning languages, web technology trends, code conventions and practices, cryptocurrency, blockchain.
