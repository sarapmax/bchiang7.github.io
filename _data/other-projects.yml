    This was my senior project when I was doing a bachelor's degree at Mae Fah Luang University in Thailand. I was one of eight students in the group. It is an e-commerce web app that sells organic products.
    The system has three roles of users (i.e., farmer, admin, customer). Farmers can add their products to the system, and admins are responsible for selecting products to sell to customers. As a result, the system can match the farmers' supply and customers' demands. <br/>
